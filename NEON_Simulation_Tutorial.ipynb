    "# Tutorial 1: CTSM Simulations at NEON Tower Sites \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an introduction to running the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM) at NEON tower sites.  It will guide you through running a simulation and provides example visualization of the simulation results. Once you complete a NEON tower simulation in this tutorial, you can use the 'NEON_Visualization_Tutorial' to explore observation and model data further.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**A few notes about the model:** There are several configuration options of CTSM, and throughout this tutorial we will use the Community Land Model (CLM) configuration which is the climate and biogeochemistry mode of CTSM. Throughout the rest of this tutorial, we refer to the model as CLM and will use version 5.1 with active biogeochemistry (CLM5.1-BGC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional information about CTSM and CLM is available [on the website](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/land/), including [technical documentation](https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/master/html/tech_note/index.html), a [user's guide](https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/master/html/users_guide/index.html), and a [quickstart guide](https://escomp.github.io/CESM/release-cesm2/quickstart.html#create-a-case) for running various model configurations beyond what is covered in this tutorial.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions about this tutorial?** Please post them on the [CTSM forum in the CESM Bulletin Board](https://bb.cgd.ucar.edu/cesm/forums/ctsm-clm-mosart-rtm.134/). Note that this resource will require you to register and log in so that you can be notified of responses to your inquiries.
